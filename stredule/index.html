                        Streaming Schedule is designed to make it easier for you to keep track of when new titles are added to your favorite
                        streaming services, whether it is the next season or a brand-new show or movie. The app aggregates information from the
                        top streaming platforms â€“ Netflix, HBOMax, AppleTV+, Disney+, and Prime Video. (Although there are just five featured on
                        the app right now more will be added in future). One of the biggest differences between this and a lot of other apps out
                        there is that rather than providing you details about what shows and films are currently on your favorite platforms,
                        Streaming Schedule actually tells you details of shows and films that are not currently streaming but are coming soon.<br/>
