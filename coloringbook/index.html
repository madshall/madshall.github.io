                <p>
                    Kids Coloring Book was made by loving parents who appeared to be a software developer and a graphics designer.<br />
                    We wanted to combine our children's creativity development with their eager to learn technology. 
                    Well, to grab "technology" first and then (if "technology" survives) learn it.<br /><br />
                    We aimed to make the application an easy and fun introduction into modern world. We designed its user interface in the way that 
                    even infants would understand what's going to happen next. There are no pointless questions like "Do you really want to go back and discard your progress?". 
                    This really means nothing to a 2-3 year old except "Yay, D is for dog!". D is indeed for dog, but it doesn't help interracting with the application. 
                    We used visual representation for that sort of things.<br /><br />
                    We hope that our application will help your children build skills for using "technology" as well as develop their creativity. 
                    We also hope it will give you some time to eat in peace. Cheers!
